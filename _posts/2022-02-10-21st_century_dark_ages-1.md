# 1. OUR DISSONANT HISTORICAL RHYME  
History does indeed rhyme, but as we sit at the start of the 21st century human civilization is quickly experiencing monumental changes which represent an inflection point that will determine what kind of brave new world our children will be born into. While still rhyming with our past, we are composing a new historical musical genre that is vastly more complex, technical, degenerative, and dissonant than those of our ancestors.  

Intended for curious philosophers of all walks of life, in this text I argue that human civilization—for the first time now coalesced into a truly globalized, universal history—is slipping deeper into a novel type of scientific dark age characterized by significant and dangerous global economic, intellectual, and cultural decline. Led and bedazzled by un-elected techno-scientific experts, both our political leaders and the distracted masses they oversee have remained stubbornly unconscious of the development of this despotic technocracy, in great part due to misguided and narrow-sighted assessments of the sources of oppression we experience in contemporary life.  

We are on Plato’s ship of fools and our captains, with techno-scientific Rasputins at their side, are driving us all towards oblivion with their zealous obsession to prove their mastery of navigation by achieving ever more complex technical feats. Into the stars we go!  

As I, the author, have no professional, political, or otherwise collective affiliations other than being a fellow human being, I write from the depths of my heart with the most loving intentions. This regrettably, but necessarily difficult position is intended as a treatise of hope in a post-modern world in which things are unfortunately often perceived in reverse, inside-out, upside-down—the ugly is seen as beautiful and the beautiful as ugly, the transgressive as righteous, and the righteous as transgressive.  

History shows us that when the human condition worsens, growing numbers are invariably “awakened” to their reality in one form or another and seek out ways to avoid or challenge their oppressors. When and if we wake up, it takes some time for our eyes to adjust and for the grogginess to dissipate, and this is precisely the point in thought where we align and entrust our destiny to religion, government, or other collective forms of thought and action. None of us are exempt from this taking this leap of faith.  

In our attempts to identify our oppressors and bring them into sight—whether they be individuals, collective, ideological, or even a material, environmental form of oppression such as hunger—many, like flies drawn to the bright, hypnotic, flickering flame of a lamp, fall prey to rhetorical and technological spectacles that cannot be sustained for any extended period without unnatural supports. Instead of leading us out into the natural, nurturing warmth of the sun or the glimmering of the stars as our ancient physiology is inclined to do, these artificial, man-made lamp-lights draw us into dark rooms poorly adapted to our needs and with no way out. These “flames” are but distractions that, throughout history, have always burned out themselves and their followers.  

In the history of philosophy, early civilization’s notions of materialism and empiricism enabled us to measure, build, and observe more precisely, eventually evolving into our modern-day natural sciences made up of chemistry, biology, physics, and mathematics which are fundamentally based on philosophical materialism, or physicalism. Physicalism and the modern quantitative sciences are centered around the categorical closure that reality is made exclusively of physical matter—the elements of the periodic table—that in one way or another can be sensed, observed, or measured. Put simply, physicalism posits that “what my net can’t catch isn’t fish”.  

Before physicalism became widely accepted among the general public, during Europe’s medieval dark ages religion and submission to biblical faith was society’s principal mechanism and guiding force, our Prime Directive. As positivist notions of progress and the Enlightenment spread, physicalism and the quantitative sciences gradually displaced theology and metaphysical inquiry of the intangible. The undeniable efficacy and precise, repeatable outcomes offered by the symbiotic relationship between scientific experimentation and technical development served to enshrine empiricism as a new sort of divine revelation, and technology as a seemingly miraculous manifestation of physicalism. In the process, we not only pushed aside creation stories from theology, but even our rich, wise, ancient philosophical tradition and all qualitative, non-empirical systems of thought.  

In other words, in to today’s epoch, empiricism is divine revelation. Science and technology are religion. Universities and technical institutes are the church. Scientists and technicians are the clergy.  

This unfortunately bitter interpretation is intended as an aid to help pull our vision away from techno-scientific cult’s hypnotic artificial lamp-light of quantitative progress above all else. In today’s society, he who questions or speaks against the incessant march of technological progress is a heretic. Red pill or blue pill? The choice is yours; the consequences are ours. Let us hereticate!
