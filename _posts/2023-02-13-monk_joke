A Buddhist monk walks up to a hot dog vendor and says: "Make me one with everything".  

After a brief chuckle, the vendor makes the hot dog and gives it to the monk, saying "That will be $4 please". After the monk hands over a $10 bill, he finds himself waiting uncomfortably while the vendor does nothing except stare back at him.  

Awkwardly the monk asks "What about my change?" "Ah," replies the hot dog vendor, "Change must come from within".
