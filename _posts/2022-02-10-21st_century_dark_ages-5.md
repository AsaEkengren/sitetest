# 5. HU(WO)MAN(LGBTQ+)ITY IN THE POST-MODERN AGE
What does this new act in our collective human opera look and sound like? How will it determine civilization’s metaphorical music and dance of the future? As evidence to the claim that we are living in a 21st century scientific dark age, what might we say is the universal human reality in our post-modern technological society?  

As we satisfy our basic material needs, our mental and spiritual world becomes increasingly desolate and unbearable, and we look to fill artificial needs that multiply into infinity.  

As our towns grow into mega-cities where “culture” unites us in mass gatherings, physical isolation, loneliness, and division have become pandemic.  

As the economy becomes truly global and the measurable standard of living improves in developing countries, the rules of the game are set by entrenched oligarchies operating fiat currencies with nothing in our physical reality to back them up as they continue to expand their share of the world’s financial and material wealth.  

As global literacy increases and information flows more freely than ever before, ignorance and radicalism have little problem finding new adherents, and wisdom has become ever more rare. Rather than standing on the shoulders of giants, we are sitting on the ground with our backs turned against the metaphorical giant of collective human wisdom.  

As technology enables us to virtually visit any one, any where, and at any time, many are never truly present with others and their immediate surroundings, and an astonishing number of people limit their social interaction to the lame digital translation of reality into 0’s and 1’s. With our virtual avatars present everywhere at all times, our physical human form finds itself nowhere forever.  

As we are seemingly freer than ever and have autonomy to decide who we are and want to be, including not only cultural and ideological affiliations but even gender and race, the trade-off has been the loss of invaluable, long-held, ancestral traditions of identity and family. We have abandoned our history and with a broad brush stroke labeled any cultural continuity as inferior, backward, and having no place in a “civilized” society.  

As we conquer space, time, and step further into the stars, the more disconnected and negligent we have become with each other and the only planet we call home.  

As we discover more and more scientific facts, it becomes harder and harder to find any semblance of shared purpose, meaning, or truth.  

As we subdue and domesticate the forces of nature, mankind becomes its own greatest existential threat to existence.  

Although today’s increasingly secular society tends to view religion as the epitome of thoughtless dogma, we have largely failed to see how physicalism is also severely limiting our scope of thought and action, bringing us to this dark corner of history. As the clergy of the secular church working via universities, technical institutes, and large enterprises, today’s scientists and technicians are propagating a new form of despotic group-think that radically limits our understanding of human nature and reality to the natural sciences and the physically observable. The danger in this dynamic resides in the fact that the quantitative sciences can proceed without much difficulty even if physicists or engineers, for instance, happen to have an incorrect understanding of human nature, while social inquiry, on the other hand, is effectively stunted when we have a mistaken or lacking understanding of human nature.  

Both political leaders and the average man now zealously follow these modern-day preachers and wholly accept their eschatological visions of what will redeem the human race from pain, discomfort, death, and, ultimately, apocalypse, which science posits as the time when our galaxy’s sun will supernova. As things stand, it appears to be infinitely more likely that man himself will bring about his own demise in search of solutions to particular problems before ever reaching this incomprehensibly distant point in time.  

In the fields of energy and weaponry, the development of nuclear fission and the atomic bomb represented one of the pivotal moments of our past century, marking the paradigm shift from the modern to the post-modern age in which humans now represent our own greatest existential threat. Since the past century, techno-scientific advances have clearly increased in speed and scope, but social inquiry has been severely retarded and limited to applications for narrow political or economic purposes. The result is that humanity is held hostage by the dangerous cycle in which politics and propaganda engineer mass support, government and large enterprises furnish materials, and technologies are ultimately made reality by optimistic technicians excited to get their hands on state-of-the-art facilities and equipment to achieve technical feats and ensure their own personal well-being. To make matters worse, most techno-scientific advances take place behind closed doors without any public oversight or accountability. Despite his initially naive position as a technician pushing forward the frontiers of science, J. Robert Oppenheimer was horrified when he witnessed the atomic bombs he helped create put to use against innocent humans in Japan, famously saying “I have become death, the destroyer of worlds”.  

Whether it is developing more efficient tools of death or escaping existential threats like global warming or mortality, the techno-scientific clergy offers an easy-to-understand, quick fix to particular problems. To provide some specific examples, electricity solves the limitations of darkness and labor, motor vehicles solve the issues of time and space, and opiates solve pain. The efficiency of these solutions is unquestionable, but we are also aware of the serious, unintended, and often detrimental trade-offs of the widespread use of electricity and motor vehicles (e.g., increased consumption and dependence on fossil fuels, pollution, etc.) and opiate use for pain management (e.g., addiction, psychosis), respectively. At the advent of every new technology, we are never fully capable of anticipating what new problems might arise precisely because we solved another, more immediate and pressing problem. We can only ponder, what might be the unintended consequences of merging man with machine or colonizing distant planets in order to survive the eventual supernova of our solar system? Upon achieving these goals, will there be any place for humans to exist as we know ourselves to be today?  

Despite whatever personal beliefs you or I may hold, as we advance in time and are written into the annals of history like our ancestors before us, our age will be remembered in a broad brush stroke as a single, unitary mono in terms of the great empires, institutions, and macro-historical processes that shape our period. How will the humanity of the future remember us as the inhabitants of the early-21st century? Will they see our times as a continuation of the age of progress and part of an incessant, linear improvement in the human condition? On the contrary, is it possible that we are in the midst of a scientific dark age leading to some unforeseen disaster which future generations will judge us harshly for having allowed occur? If Rome could last 500 years, what will throw the wrench inside our gears?  

We cannot even attempt to understand where we are coming from or where we are going without an adequate philosophy of history and the metaphysical mind, but it seems hopeless to expect that influential community figures and leaders begin seriously considering the shortcomings and limitations of our current understanding of reality and how this impacts how we decide to move forward as a species. While seemingly futile, it would be wise for us to remain prudent and weary of prescriptive technological solutions inciting action based on the faith that science and technology will redeem the human race before we reach a new calamity that overshadows the disasters and catastrophes that afflicted the past.  

With all the unresolved gaps, contradictions, and shortcomings of the quantitative sciences and the eternal fact that there always remains more to be learned than what is already known, it may very well be that we will never be able to properly explain or predict the mystery of the human individual and collective by purely outward empirical observation and revelation. In our age of information overload, it is more critical than ever that we learn to discern between fact and truth, knowledge and wisdom. It would be at our own peril to call a child with Wikipedia wise or to ignore the lessons of history and our sages.  

We must somehow find a way to take a step back from the dogmatic application of the empirical, quantitative sciences which has created a powerful tunnel-vision that makes us the tools of our tools rather than their masters. As the adage goes, “To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail”. We still have the opportunity to contemplate the quickly changing landscape of tools and think more deeply about the potential consequences of techno-scientific progress on humanity before acting.  

We cannot unsee what has been seen. We cannot undiscover or unlearn what has been discovered and learned. Maybe we will continue amusing ourselves to death while our captains direct our ship of fools into artificial lamp-lights that will char us crispy like bugs. In the words of Kurt Vonnegut, “Those who live by electronics, die by electronics. Sic semper tyrannis”.  

At this present historical junction, we are assembling a choir and setting our instruments to the tune of a dissonant sort of technical electronic death metal while our conductors are unaware of our immediate human reality as they stare into tubes and collect ever more data and discover ever more “objective” facts. Nay, I say! Before we reach the point of no return, let us get back in tune with the poetic epic, the mysterious opera that is human history and find a viable, regenerative rhythm that allows us to continue composing beautiful melodies far into the future.
