I worked at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) for 6.5 years and learned quite a bit about how to create and deliver presentations. BCG and other top-tier management consulting firms--McKinsey, Deloitte, PwC, Accenture, etc.--

# Key Principles
## Structure
- Executive summary upfront (usually page 3 or 4 or so)
- Agenda pages (fly sheets) in between each chapter to prevent the reader from getting lost  
## Wording
- Titles tell a story and conclusions; each page answers the question “So What?”  
- Exhaustive footnotes and references  
## Format
- Relentlessly consistent formatting  
- Lots of frameworks, buckets, and hypothesis-based consulting; the good stuff  
- Significant industry research to set context and establish credibility  
- Visual presentations (conveying ideas and data with shapes, tables, graphs; never pie charts!)  

- Use of quotations from interviews and stakeholders  
- Surveys to provide quantification of normally qualitative impressions  
- Restrained use of colors and clipart
