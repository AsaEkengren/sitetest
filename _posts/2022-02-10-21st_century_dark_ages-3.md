# 3. SCIENTISTS STEPPING BACK FROM THE SCOPE
We have just touched on what it is that positivist empirical observation is missing: the qualitative, the metaphysical. It would be to our peril to ignore these facets of our existence, but what can we even do about this dilemma? Aren’t we doomed to failure if true progress consists of finding shared meaning and action based on the intangible? Won’t that just bring us back into the original, medieval dark ages when everything and seemingly anything was done in the name of God? In continuing and attempting to address these valid questions, even if only indirectly, we should acknowledge two facts too often forgotten or overlooked.  

First and foremost, there will always be more that we do not know than that which we do know. There is, in other words, always more that remains to be known or discovered than what is already known, and this is true on both the individual and collective level. Any objections to this statement are rhetorical illusion, and only a sincere, indemonstrable faith can assume that science will one day allow us to understand or reveal the initial act or movement of creation that set the universe in motion, and thereby our entire reality. Similarly, medicine may never be able to claim to attain an ultimate, full, complete understanding of the human body.  

Secondly, the instant a scientist steps outside of the laboratory and beyond the techniques of scientific hypothesis and testing, or measurement; the very moment that this is done, they are stepping outside the reliable boundaries of the empirical sciences and into the jurisdiction of philosophy, politics, and even theology.  

Overstepping one’s personal area of expertise in the public sphere was not such a grave problem in the past, particularly in light of the fact that scholarship was reserved for a literate minority and understood to consist of a relatively balanced and complete understanding of all possible fields of human knowledge, including the arts. Even as late as the 18th century, prominent leaders acted simultaneously as a scientist, entrepreneur, politician, and philosopher, in stark contrast to today’s supposedly enlightened political buffoons who know little other than how to create spectacle and manipulate public opinion.  

We are now faced with unprecedented problems our ancestors never fathomed due to exponential growth in the depth and complexity of all fields of knowledge, particularly techno-scientific empiricism which has displaced all other schools and systems of knowledge under the auspices of being the one, absolute, capital “T” Truth—the king of all ways of knowing.  

As the scientific method and empirical techniques have developed in recent centuries, scientists have become incredibly proficient at breaking down natural phenomena into the smallest observable parts—the cell, atom, molecule, quark, particle, ad infinitum—as well as peering ever further into outer space and galaxies strewn across the universe.  

The scientific method is to our mind’s eye as a telescope or microscope is to our biological eyes. These marvelous laboratory tools enable us gaze further into the stars and deeper into previously invisible micro-worlds, but we must remember that while operating these instruments the user’s vision of their immediate surroundings are necessarily reduced or even completely eliminated.  

The point here is that there is a Faustian bargain in which we both increase and diminish our options when we use a telescope, microscope, “empiriscope,” or any other perception-altering tool or technique. In addition to modifying what is within sight, these instruments change the blurry, indefinite outer-rim that determines your available scope of vision. By simultaneously enhancing and limiting our natural sight—and in the case of empiricism, thought—our inability to take a step back from our tools is distorting our perception of reality in ways we are only beginning to understand. We can only hope that there is no imminent or encroaching danger while we, the scientists, remain blissfully oblivious to our immediate human dimensions as we stare into alien worlds through a scope-altering tube.  

The scientific method—and more precisely, the scientific community of individuals among whose minds the scientific method resides in physical reality—prides itself on being objective and open to perpetual review when presented with conclusions from sound reasoning and logical testing of hypotheses. In the words of Oppenheimer, “There is no place for dogma in science. The scientist is free, and must be free to ask any question, to doubt any assertion, to seek for any evidence, to correct any errors”. Will the scientists look up from their laboratory equipment, their “scopes,” if someone, maybe even a non-technician, a plebe using their natural sight, their naked eye, taps their shoulder with a warning of impending carnal danger?  

Despite having little notion of continuity or history, scientists and technicians consider their clerical caste to be the only one capable of understanding and interpreting divine revelation and establishing the providence of the church on Earth. Unfortunately, the increasingly specialized division of labor has resulted in a techno-scientific pseudo-clergy that knows close to nothing about, for example, the advent of human language or the printing press, morality, ethics, industrialization, or political ideologies, and even less about their broader philosophical and social impacts. The more we specialize, the deeper runs the division not only of labor, but of thought and mind as well.  

Just as it would be hopelessly futile for a modern-day philosopher, for instance, to act as an astronomer, architect, or surgeon by assuming their functions and taking hold of their tools of the trade, scientists and technicians are generally gravely ill-equipped to address qualitative, metaphysical human affairs and ignorantly arrogant about the imposition of scientific positivism upon all forms of knowledge and reality. Techno-scientific endeavoring has completely displaced, and thereby forced into submission huge swaths of knowledge and philosophy from religion, the humanities, social sciences, and even psychology and other sciences of the mind, since they are not, and cannot be understood based on empirical, quantitative observation and analysis alone.  

The arts of systematic inquiry of qualitative reality we have inherited from theology, philosophy, and history may have severe limitations and pitfalls, but it is precisely because they address the unquantifiable, higher-level, sum of the parts of human affairs—the collective social personality or gestalt—that they continue to be and will forever remain so valuable and necessary to our survival. Systematic study based on empiricism alone will never be enough to explain the metaphysical human social dimension and reality, which is why the laws of science cannot be applied to history or politics.  

Like a single word out of context, scientific facts have no purpose or true meaning on their own, and they must be used semantically to give them said purpose and meaning. It goes without saying, there is nothing in either words or facts themselves to dictate where or how they should be used either within a sentence or group politics, respectively. Despite the fact that semantic meaning cannot be attributed to scientific facts without context rooted in the universal human dimension and reality, nearly all of our collective decisions are being made by oligarchies of technocrats who claim the right to rule based on “truths,” each in their respective, short-sighted field of expertise.  

Again we find ourselves at the point in thought where the mysteries of the human mind and consciousness come into play; the point at which scientists, technicians, and their followers fall prey to artificial lamp-lights guiding their understanding and application of objectively meaningless, empirical facts and techniques. Not even the supposedly objective techno-scientific clergy themselves are above or free from these inner, mental, and therefore immaterial forces which, as far as we know, are eternal and universal. Human power dynamics, love, desire, justice, compassion, stupidity, mental fortitude, and even notions of a soul represent the universal metaphysical forces that, throughout time, have shaped human history, ideas, and activity; that is, civilization itself.  

Physicalists can write off these aspects of our existence as mere romantic notions or mysticism, but if we listen attentively to our history and sages—if we actually stand on the shoulders of giants rather than ignore them—it is clear that these forces have been a key part of humanity since our primordial beginnings. As far as we know, love is real, eternal, and therefore objectively more true than our perpetually-changing scientific facts, nonetheless we remain slaves to empiricism and the dogma of quantification which reduces our understanding of love to soulless mechanical biochemical operations and natural selection.  

The techno-scientific cult and its followers say, “If it can be done, it will be done!” Wisdom and its adherents will beg the question, “Should it be done?”
