# 2. A BRIEF CRITIQUE OF PROGRESS
Let us take a prudent first step and simply note the fact that believers of the “law of progress” now constitute the overwhelming majority of global leadership and the culture we have been raised in. What exactly does progress even mean?  

Decorated Harvard psychologist, Steven Pinker, provides a prime example of optimistic views that the spread of European Enlightenment values—liberty, progress, tolerance, fraternity, constitutional government, and separation of church and state—has allowed us unparalleled levels of human well-being3. Like many other zealously optimistic techno-scientific clergy, for Pinker, the litmus test to observe human progress towards improved well-being is exclusively based on empirical measurements, data, and numbers, such as indicators on literacy rates, poverty correlated to income, education correlated to level of study, and freedom correlated to democratic forms of government. Implicit in these correlations are some unfortunate assumptions that can be addressed as follows.  

By correlating literacy with progress, we assume that being able to read is good, without mention or regard for what the reader actually reads. Let’s hope it isn’t only Mao Zedung’s Little Red Book or Adolf Hitler’s Mein Kampf!  

Similar narrow logic is applied to indicators correlating ownership of physical devices and technologies such as electricity, telecommunications, and personal computers to human well-being. As in the previous example on literacy, these types of assessments rarely attempt to address the specific applications or the content channeled through these mediums. The social impacts of using electricity for lighting versus an electric chair, for example, are clearly radically different, so it is quite an over-simplification to claim that more is better without qualification or regards to the prevalence of their uses.  

On poverty, we assume it impossible to have above-average income and live in poverty. The wise know that poverty can take on many forms and is not exclusively a monetary affair or material state of being. A rich man who ceaselessly needs to acquire more material wealth is condemned to perpetual poverty.  

On education, we assume that anybody who has not studied at accredited institutions is uneducated. We know that most of our ancestors and even many notable contemporaries never received a modern, Humboldtian education like ours, but this didn’t make them any less intelligent, astute, or most importantly, wise.  

On freedom, the assumption is made that democratic forms of government are not only more free, but objectively better than any other. This is pure historical idealism which has no place for discussion in objective scientific inquiry. The concept of freedom is so vastly complex that even philosophers find it difficult to give a clear definition and address it comprehensively.  

Pinker’s notion of progress equates more with better regardless of context, but to do so despite evidence to the contrary is to be no better than a beast that gorges itself full of food until the point of illness. It is precisely the rational part of the human consciousness that tells a person to stop eating before falling ill, usually based on previous experience of some sort. To not do so would be shortsighted and lead to unnecessary suffering. While serving only as a small sample, the statements provided grant some basic orientation on how we can begin to unpackage and recognize the limits of some of the audacious claims being made by technocrats.  

We surely agree on the undeniably practical and effective power of reducing complex phenomena into data so as to have “hard facts” upon which to test and apply techniques, but while physicalism and its manifestations in science and technology have granted us unimaginable control over nature and enabled us to attain untold material wealth—meaning, it works!—in our 21st century dark age, empiricism and positivist progress have arrogantly invaded and displaced all other fields of human knowledge, thought, and action based on the claim of a superior, virtually divine truth. Like all other comprehensive and systematic worldviews, philosophical empiricism claims to be the only reliable approach to revealing reality and, in turn, the true, universal human condition.  

In fact, our contemporary landscape of modern political “ism’s,”—liberalism, socialism, capitalism, communism, fascism, anarchism, etc.—as well as the underlying techniques which sustain them—government, bureaucracy, propaganda, economics, war, etc.—all share their roots in the very idea of systematic, repeatable techniques as ascertained from empirical revelation. Rather than acting in the name of “moving,” or pleasing a biblical God, our modern-day collective actions are directed towards literally moving abstract numbers and data-points, such as gross domestic product (GDP), gross national happiness (GNH), or maybe the worst, the Big Mac Index. Yes, these all really exist.  

Following the line of logic set by positivists who maintain that the physical human brain creates, and therefore appears prior to the metaphysical mind, political and historical materialists similarly maintain that physical, material conditions create and give form to our metaphysical, collective ideas, not the other way around. This fundamentally empirical position has been adopted by world leadership and is propagated in our education and media. The fact that secular political “ism’s” have largely overtaken all former bodies of thought and systems of collectivization supports the thesis that physicalism is now hegemonic.  

Monarchies justified and reinforced their governments with the approval of the church and divine right. Modern day nation states are justified in the name of science and technology, and blessed by the clergy of technical progress operating out of universities. The medieval church blessed our kings and awed the public with stunningly beautiful, epic cathedrals and just as stunningly wretched, depraved tools of war and torture. Our current governments have become technocracies under the contemporary clergy of scientists and technicians wielding the spectacles of material abundance, rocketry, genetic engineering, computing, and only more horribly powerful, apocalyptic instruments of war that now threaten our very existence as a species.  

Anybody having studied or experienced the spread of ideologies understands that ideas do indeed also materialize and form our physical reality. The same occurs in consciousness insomuch as the brain creates the mind, but the metaphysical mind is also what creates our understanding of the physical brain itself, so we can never definitively separate the two from one another. To the contrary, positivist empirical revelation and its techno-scientific clergy has formed categorical closures insisting on the exclusively material nature of reality, and this has far-reaching consequences.  

Like most deeper reflection in the age of entertainment, many rigorous, noteworthy critiques of Pinker’s thesis have been drowned out and ignored by the roaring noise of rhetoric and spectacle that serves as an easy escape from our darkening reality. How can religion, philosophy, or history even attempt to compete with technical splendor as Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos launch cars and billionaires into outer space?  

Despite the ever-so-many illusions, the fact remains; there is no empirical method of observation available to support a comprehensive, stable theory of qualitative elements of the human condition. In other words, numbers will never be able to completely reveal reality since we necessarily live a human existence in which facts and information are strung together with semantic meaning and qualitative, metaphysical concepts like beauty and ugliness, right and wrong, good and bad, false and true.
